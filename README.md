This project is separated in two repositories, one for the backend and other for the frontend. To navigate between the two repositories use these links:
- Frontend: [not yet]()
- Backend: [https://github.com/Jofay-zs/ztrore](https://github.com/Jofay-zs/ztrore)

In this README.md you will find a documentation more focused on the frontend.

# Description
## What was the goal of the project ? 😀
Develop a DApp (Desentralized Application), where anyone could enter and could generate and obtain their NFT. Also encourage people to develop with web3 technologies.

## What does the project do ? 🏪
ztrore is a NFT marketplace compatible with the EIP 721 standar of Ethereum. Where you can generate and obtain an NFT. This are all the NFTs generated: [https://testnets.opensea.io/assets/ztrore](https://testnets.opensea.io/assets/ztrore)

## How and what was it build with ? 🥣
It was created with technologies and tools like: Solidity, Open Zeppelin, Hardhat, React, JS, Tailwind, a lot of documetation and videos. To see more about the tools and technologies [scroll down 🔽](#tools-and-technologies-used).

## Technical difficulties ⚗️
The biggest problem I found was in smart contracts, due to my little knowledge on them. Also I have some difficulties writing the documentation, due to my regular English.

## Improvements for the future 🔮
I thought of two options for the future of this project.
1. Use other APIs to generate different NFTs, some examples of APIs that I found was, a kitten API generator, a Robot API generator and a Monster API generator.
2. Which personally I consider more difficult, but exciting, is re-create the entire app with assets created by me, and adding more metadata, to create more unique and different NFTs. Explore smart contracts more and use more features of the technologies that I used. Also I can implement chainlink so the generation of nft is not predictible.
